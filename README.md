## Quick install


## Requirements

## Ambinition
Firstly easier API usability. Thats why this SDK can prevent errors before you request the data. <br>
Besides preventing errors when communicating with Palmys server, I'd also like to ensure that there are more open source rescources related to <b>investing and finance</b>.<br><br> Thats why the utilities of palmy-python are not limitted to the API handling. Instead I've decided to create the <b>PalmyHandler</b>. A class within common financial usecases and methods to use when dealing with financial data. Besides them, as always you are theoretically able to overwrite everything you want, but keep in mind that this might result in a reduced usability of our API.
